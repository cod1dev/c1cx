From the Activision license:

> You agree not to:  
•	Reverse engineer, derive source code, modify, decompile, or disassemble the Program, in whole or in part.  
•	New Game Materials shall not contain modifications to any COM, EXE or DLL files or to any other executable Product files.

We are not applying the license of the program we are based on, so we do not add a license on top of that.
